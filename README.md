# VRMLConverter
C++ converter application. It can parse whole VRML objects hierarchy and convert into other format (like DirectX)<br>
There are a lot of object types in VRML, so supporting all of them very hard. This programm supports basic VRML object types and can convert simple 3d model.<br>
But this algorithm scales easily. All you need is to add new objects classes and their parsing functions<br>
